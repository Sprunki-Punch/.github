## What is Sprunki Punch?

[Abgerny Game](https://github.com/Abgerny-Game) is a modification of the beloved *Incredibox* game that redefines the traditional gameplay. Unlike the original, where players create music by arranging different beats and melodies, Sprunki Punch challenges you to click as fast as possible to score points. The objective is simple but addictive: target the distinctive orange character, known as **Oren**, and click or tap rapidly to accumulate points. The game tracks your clicks per second (CPS) and rewards you with bonus points for maintaining a consistent rhythm. As you achieve higher CPS rates, you earn more points, which can help you climb the global leaderboard and achieve bragging rights among players.

## Key Features of Sprunki Punch

Sprunki Punch includes various features that set it apart from traditional clicker games:

1. **Dynamic Point System**: Earn points based on how fast and accurately you click.
2. **Speed-Based Multipliers**: The faster you click, the more points you earn. Keep the rhythm to unlock higher multipliers.
3. **Global Leaderboards**: Compete against players worldwide for top rankings.
4. **Performance Tracking**: Monitor your CPS, accuracy rates, and overall game performance in real-time.
5. **Social Integration**: Share your achievements across major platforms like Reddit and Twitter to challenge your friends.

## How to Play Sprunki Punch

The game mechanics are easy to learn but challenging to master. The core objective is to click or tap on Oren as fast as possible while maintaining accuracy. Hereâ€™s a quick guide on how to play Sprunki Punch effectively:

1. **Start Clicking**: Tap Oren repeatedly to accumulate points. Each click adds to your score, but maintaining a steady rhythm increases your multiplier.
2. **Optimize for Speed and Accuracy**: Balancing speed and precision is essential. Aim for consistent clicking rather than random bursts to maximize your points.
3. **Take Breaks When Necessary**: High-speed clicking can cause finger fatigue. To keep your CPS high, take short breaks when needed.
